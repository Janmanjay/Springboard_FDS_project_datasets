# How to contribute

There are only so many datasets I can find and think are fertile ground for students' capstone
projects. In fact many of the ones I've already highlighted were actually brought to my attention
by others. You are welcome to contribute additional suggestions. Bear in mind a good dataset is
one that is readily available; we don't want the student to set off writing code to scrape the
web and deal with all that hassle (unless web scraping is already a very familiar task to them). Data
that are available to download in a single, or a few, CSV files (or similar) are ideal. Yes, in
the real world data comes in more formats, but there's only so much we can cover! The data ideally
would benefit from some wrangling such as checking for, and dealing with, missing values and
creating features or reformating/shaping. The student would then be able to *do* something with
the data to answer their question(s). A great dataset is one that supports this activity *and*
still offers some scope to go further, to dig deeper, if all goes well. A bad dataset is one that
comprises only a 5x4 data frame or one that is so fiendishly vast and dirty that they're having
nightmares two months later on! Do have a look at what is already highlighted here, and if
you'd like to contribute your own featured dataset, please try to follow the same format
(or suggest a better format, I'm always open!) and include:

## Title
A few words/sentence.

### Keywords
A few short words/phrases you think might help searching.

### Summary
A couple few sentences giving a quick overview what the data are about.

### What [you] love about it
Why are you so keen on this dataset that you're telling us about it? What makes it good
for a student's project in your eyes?

### How do [you] get it?
Its location is obviously somewhat helpful if we're to download it!
